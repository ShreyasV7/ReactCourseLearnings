->will the order of file matter?
It will throw an error.If we change the order of the 
files in index.html then it will call React is not defined

->what is crossorign?


When you render the root in javascript, it updates 
it in HTML quickly

Even if you have mentioned something in the HTML,it will get replaced

The browser 1st reads the whole HTML and after it will read the script tag in which our .js file is present.
Then it will render the whole root...It will replace everything in root. IT WILL REPLACE NOT APPENDED !!! 

-> React can be applied to small portion of a page also.That's an advantage of it being a library

-> Order of file matters a lot and what is root where we are rendering stuff

->React is a library, not a full flegeded framework
