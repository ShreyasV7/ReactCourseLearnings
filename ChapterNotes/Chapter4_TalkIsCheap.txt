 Style in react takes it as a JS object
 <div className='res-card' style={}>
 </div>

 - Props are passing an argument to a Component
 - React will take all the props and wrap it inside an object, and pass over as (props)=>{}

 - De-structuring on Fly method

 Eg:
 const Restaurant=({resName,cuisine}=>{
  
  return (
    <h2>{resName}<h3>
    <h2>{cuisine}<h3>
  )

 })

 - Destructing is simple plain JS, React is not doing any cool stuff

 - Config Driven UI (helpful in System Design interviews)
   -Controlling the UI on how it looks using Data, using a config. This config comes from Backend.
   Eg: Swiggy Mumbai has different UI and Swiggy Banglore has different UI 
   -All the whole UI is driven by Config.
   -You should always build config driven UI 
   -A good senior frontend engineer is good in both UI layer and Data layer



- OPTIMZATION
1. Learn de-structuring

=> You always have to give a key
WHY ?? 
- Without key it will treat all components same at DOM level. So it will re-render it over and over all components
-If id is mentioned for each component, then it will get exactly to know which component to be rendered properly
- It takes a BIG PERFORMANCE HIT, If you don't write keys
- React's official doc, says DON'T USE INDEXES(0,1,2...) AS KEYS
- Read blog on Robin Pokorny on INDEX AS A KEY PATTERN
- Using INDEX is Not RECOMMENDED. We can use, it but its better to use KEY.
- not using keys (not acceptable) <<<<< index as key
<<<<< unique id (best practice)
