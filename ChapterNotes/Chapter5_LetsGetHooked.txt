- Best practice in the industry is to make seperate files for seperate components
- In the src folder, all sources files are present
- Make a seperate file for seperate components. 


- Every thing we do in React can also be done in HTML,CSS,JS. Then why react ??? 
1. It makes developer exp easy.
2. Write less code, do more on Web Page.
3. React makes better coding exp and optimizes it efficently


- Never keep hardcoded stuff into components file
KEEP IT SIMPLE

- All the utilities are kept in Utils folder


- There are 2 types of export and 2 types of import

1. Named export/import 
  - To export multiple things
  - Just wirte "export" infront of const to export 
  - Write "import { CDN_URL } from "../utils/constants" to import stuff from other files
  - For default export, we don't use {}


2. Default export/import 
  - It will export only 1 single constant during export 
  - And in innport no {} are required


Q. Can i use default export along with a named export ?
