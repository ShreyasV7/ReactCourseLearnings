- Best practice in the industry is to make seperate files for seperate components
- In the src folder, all sources files are present
- Make a seperate file for seperate components. 


- Every thing we do in React can also be done in HTML,CSS,JS. Then why react ??? 
1. It makes developer exp easy.
2. Write less code, do more on Web Page.
3. React makes better coding exp and optimizes it efficently


- Never keep hardcoded stuff into components file
KEEP IT SIMPLE

- All the utilities are kept in Utils folder


- There are 2 types of export and 2 types of import

1. Named export/import 
  - To export multiple things
  - Just wirte "export" infront of const to export 
  - Write "import { CDN_URL } from "../utils/constants" to import stuff from other files
  - For default export, we don't use {}


2. Default export/import 
  - It will export only 1 single constant during export 
  - And in innport no {} are required


Q. Can i use default export along with a named export ? 

- Event handler in JS (read it)
- onClick is an attribute, it takes a callback function. 
It will be called on click.

-map filter reduce video in NamasteJS
-React does DOM manipulation faster
-The mock data which we are using, we can write it inside our component as well as outside of our component. 

Eg:
1.
 const Body=()=>{
   let mockData=[....]; 
   return(....); 
 }; 
 export default Body ;


2. 
 let mockData=[....]; 
 const Body=()=>{
   return(....); 
 }; 

 export default Body ;


Both of the above works

- React Element at the end of the day is a JS object











************  REACT HOOKS *******************

- They are normal JS utility functions
- written by FB developers
- They have written inside React 


1. useState => super powerful variable provided by React 
- It is a named export from react 
- const [list,setList]=useState([default values, if any]); 
- It only works inside component, not outside
- Whenever, a state variable updates react re-renders the component (imp)

- REACT IS GOOD AT DOM OPERATIONS,THAT'S WHY IT RENDERS FAST. It doesn't do NO MINIFY,BUNDLING ALL THESE STUFF

- React creates an object out of <Body/>. This object is basically,
REACT VIRTUAL DOM. It is nothing but normal JS object

- Read about React Fiber,Diff algorithm, virtual dom (vvvimp)

- What is Virtual dom...It is basically, dom which we see those 
tags and Elements. Its JS represnetation of it.It existed way before, react just made it popular.

-React took this and built its alogirthm over virtual dom. 
- useState returns an array
-const [bestRes, setBestRes] = useState(resList) this is array 
destructuring
arr[0]=bestRes, arr[1]=setBestRes
destructuring it on fly 

2. useEffect=>
