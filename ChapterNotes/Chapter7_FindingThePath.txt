# Different pages for different URL 

- useEffect will be called everytime after the component rendering 

- The dependency array in useEffect, it changes the behaviour of its render. 

- If no dependency array => useEffect called on every compoent render 

- If dependency array is empty => useEffect is called ONLY on inital render 
(just once)

- If dependency is array is => useEffect is called everytime whatever is mentioned is updated


#useState 
- It is used for creating local state variables inside functional component







# createBrowserRouter
- Here we specify all the routes with components assciated with it. 

Eg: 
const appRouter=createBrowserRouter([
   {
        path: "/",
        element: <AppLayout />,
        errorElement: <Error />,
    },
])






# RouterProvider
- It will provide the routing configuration to our app 
- Exported from react router dom 
- It gives access to important hook which is useRouteError (it gives more info about the error)






# CHILDREN ROUTE 
- If under 1 compoent i want mutliple components to show up like a tree 
- const appRouter=createBrowserRouter([
   {
        path: "/",
        element: <AppLayout />,
        childre:[
          {
            path:.......
          },
          {
            path:......
          }
        ],
        errorElement: <Error />,
    },
])

- Outlet is a component, which is used for the above in process 
- Wherever, this <Outlet/> will be present. If there is a change in the path, it will be filled (<Outlet/> component) according to path 

- Never use anchor tag in react. Because it reloads the whole page. In react, we can navigate to new page without reloading 

- To implement above we will use LINK COMPONENT, which is given by react-router-dom 
Eg:
<Link to="/">Home</Link>
<li>
  <li>
    <Link to="/about">About</Link>
  </li>
  <li>
    <Link to="/contact">Contact Us</Link>
  </li>
</li>

- Link compoent just refreshes the component rather than reloading the component

- THAT'S WHY OUR REACT APPLICATIONS ARE CALLED SINGLE PAGE COMPONENT. 





- There are 2 types of routing: 
1. Client side routing 
2. Server side routing 

A. Server side routing 
- In this, the whole page gets reloaded whenever you move on to about,contact us page. 

- It basically sends request to server and brings back whatever is need by reloading the page 


B. Client side routing 
- In this, we have a single page appilcation and all the rendering happens at client side 




{
  path:'/restaurants/:restaurantId',
  element 
}

- In the above, :restaurantId is dynamic, our routes will be unique.
